## about this project

This is my first project using `React` and `Create React App`. So far, I've only gone through the basics, but I already feel like it's an awesome way to create a web app quickly and conveniently, thanks to the `Virtual DOM`. It's also easier to write, although the `JSX` code looks a little messier to me. Overall, I'm really excited about using `React` and can't wait to learn more about it! 

The website is all about showcasing different places in Russia, and it allows you to personalize your profile by
changing your name and job, uploading new pictures of interesting locations, and even giving them a little ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## what I learned doing this project

I learned a lot about working with frameworks, in particular the `React` framework library. Even though every framework is different, I feel more confident in delving into any of them now. I am eager to learn how `Vue.js` or `Angular` is different from `React` or each other.

Additionally, I learned about `SPA` and its benefits and drawbacks. `SPA` (Single-Page Application) has the advantage of fast and responsive user experience, but it also has some drawbacks such as long initial load time, poor `SEO`, and limited browser caching. Now I better understand when and why to use `SSR` (Server-Side Rendering) and I am excited to start learning `Next.js` in my next project. `SSR` can improve initial load time, `SEO`, and browser caching. It also enables dynamic content and better accessibility. However, it may increase server response time and decrease client-side interactivity.

The most difficult thing to comprehend for me was `HOC`. Couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around when and how to use it right since I haven‚Äôt tried it on practice yet. I definetely need to try it out in mext project with mesto project authorization.

I learned a lot about re-renders and how to optimize page rendering and what tools can help to do that. Even though it only created more questions for me I want to figure out how to optimize every component so there is no nightmares of re-renders for every action on the website üò≠.

## how I used chat GPT doing this project

While studying, I have obviously visited Stack Overflow for answers a lot. Since I tried to pose some of my questions to chat GPT, I have ended up using Stack Overflow much more seldom. Even though chat GPT cannot write a webpage for you (or can, but the code is mostly ugly and doesn‚Äôt work most of the time), I have found it very useful in the debugging process or setting up my IDE. Rarely has chat GPT given me a good solution to my code problem, but it has saved me so much time when I had problems with `git` or `IDE`, and sometimes, it has given me a better idea of where to look for an answer to my code not working correctly.

The main reason why I like to use chat GPT more than looking for answers on forums is that its answers are always given in the same manner of explanation. While reading answers on forums, you always have to adjust to someone‚Äôs way of speech and compare other people's examples with your own problem. In other words, you have to do some decoding first, which is not the case with chat GPT.
